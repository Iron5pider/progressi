# Project Charter: Helix Aterna

## **1\. Executive Summary**

* Project Overview  
  * Design a glider that can maintain flight almost indefinitely.  
* Key Innovations  
  * Regenerative multi-positional propeller design allows glider to transition between flight mode (forward facing prop) and regenerative gliding (vertical prop).  
  * Helicistical flight pattern allows the glider to position itself in a specific airspace.  
  * Self learning Al driven flight control allows for high efficiency flight paths and aircraft manipulation in conjunction with real time data.
